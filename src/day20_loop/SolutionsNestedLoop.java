 [IQ] Duplicate characters

     Given a String, find and print the duplicate characters. A character is duplicate if it appears more than once in the String.

     Ex:
         Input:
             AAABCCDEEF
         Output:
             ACE

         -> the characters A C and E are found in the String multiple times so they are duplicates

                        continue;

                        }
                    }
